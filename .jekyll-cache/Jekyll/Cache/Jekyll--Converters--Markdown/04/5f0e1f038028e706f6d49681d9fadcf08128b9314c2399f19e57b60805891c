I"‰<p>We characterize the complexity of exactly computing the maximum winning probability of entangled non-local games and show it to be strictly harder than the halting problem. In particular, we show that the class of zero-gap entangled multiprover interactive proofs, \(MIP_0^*\), is equal to \(\Pi_2\), a class within the second level of arithmetical hierarchy from computability theory.</p>
