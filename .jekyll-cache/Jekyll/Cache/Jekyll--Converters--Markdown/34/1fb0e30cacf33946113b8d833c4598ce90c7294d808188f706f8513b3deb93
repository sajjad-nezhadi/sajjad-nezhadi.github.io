I"a<p>The class 𝖬𝖨𝖯* is the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with quantum entangled provers. It was recently shown by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen that 𝖬𝖨𝖯∗ is equal to 𝖱𝖤, the set of recursively enumerable languages. In particular this shows that the complexity of approximating the quantum value of a non-local game G is equivalent to the complexity of the Halting problem. 
In this paper we investigate the complexity of deciding whether the quantum value of a non-local game G is exactly 1. This problem corresponds to a complexity class that we call zero gap 𝖬𝖨𝖯∗, denoted by 𝖬𝖨𝖯∗0, where there is no promise gap between the verifier’s acceptance probabilities in the YES and NO cases. We prove that 𝖬𝖨𝖯∗0 extends beyond the first level of the arithmetical hierarchy (which includes 𝖱𝖤 and its complement 𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖤), and in fact is equal to Π02, the class of languages that can be decided by quantified formulas of the form ∀y∃zR(x,y,z). 
Combined with the previously known result that 𝖬𝖨𝖯co0 (the commuting operator variant of 𝖬𝖨𝖯∗0) is equal to 𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖤, our result further highlights the fascinating connection between various models of quantum multiprover interactive proofs and different classes in computability theory.</p>
