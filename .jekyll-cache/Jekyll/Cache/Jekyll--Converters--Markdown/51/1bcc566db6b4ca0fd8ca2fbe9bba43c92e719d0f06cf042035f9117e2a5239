I"2<p>We introduce an algebraic generalization of CHSH by viewing it as a linear constraint system game. These provide the first example of non-local games that self-test non-Pauli operators and states other than the maximally entangled state. In order to obtain our results, we exploit connections between sum of squares proofs, non-commutative ring theory, and approximate representation theory. Finally, we give the first example of a game that is not a self-test. Our results suggest a richer landscape of self-testing phenomena than previously considered.</p>
