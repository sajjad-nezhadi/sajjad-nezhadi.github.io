I"h<p>We characterize the complexity of exactly computing the maximum winning probability of entangled non-local games and show it to be strictley harder than the halting problem. In particular we show that the class of zero gap entangled multiprover interactive proofs is equal to \(\Pi_2\) a class within the arithmetical hierrachy of computability theory.</p>
