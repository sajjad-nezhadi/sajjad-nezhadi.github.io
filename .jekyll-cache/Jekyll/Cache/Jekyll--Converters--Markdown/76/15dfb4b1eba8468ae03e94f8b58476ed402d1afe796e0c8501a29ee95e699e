I"¬<p>We introduce a family of games that generalizeÂ CHSH, viewing it as a linear constraint system game. These provide the first example of non-local games that self-test non-Pauli operators and states other than the maximally entangled state. We also introduce the Glued Magic Square game that is not a self-test for any strategy. Our results suggest a richer landscape of self-testing phenomena than previously considered.</p>
