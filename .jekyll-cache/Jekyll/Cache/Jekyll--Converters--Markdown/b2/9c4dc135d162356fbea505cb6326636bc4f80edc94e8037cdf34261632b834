I"Å<p>For testing and validating the functionality of the GINA (GuidanceÂ andÂ InertialÂ NAvigation) mote, a 1.6 gram sensor platform.</p>

<p>I wrote custom low-power firmware to disable and track the power usage the board as different components were put into sleep states. Eventually, the sum of the running componentsâ€™ current draw (after the removal of the power LEDs) was reduced to 130uA, of which 110uA were sleep-state draw from a magnetometer in single-supply configuration. Many thanks to <a href="http://wsn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Kris Pisterâ€™s research group</a>, including Dr. Anita Flynn and Dr. Thomas Watteyne and Ankur Mehta for the assistance and opportunities.</p>
