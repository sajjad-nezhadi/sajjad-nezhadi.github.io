I"Þ<p>We investigate the synchronous values of graph colouring games, XOR games, and products of games. We show the optimal strategy for a synchronous game need not be synchronous. We derive a formula for the synchronous value of an XOR game as an optimization problem over a spectrahedron and show that the synchronous quantum bias of the XOR of two XOR games is not multiplicative. Finally, we give an example of a game whos repeated product synchronous value is increasing.</p>
