I"Œ<p>We characterize the complexity of exactly computing the maximum winning probability of entangled non-local games and show it to be strictley harder than the halting problem. In particular we show that the class of zero gap entangled multiprover interactive proofs, ğ–¬ğ–¨ğ–¯âˆ—0, is equal to \(Pi_2\) a class within the second level of arithmetical hierrachy from computability theory.</p>
