I"¥<p>With Humphrey Hu, Ryan Julian, and Eric Yuan, a project to show the efficacy of multiple-robot collaborative state estimation. Using Wiimote cameras, mobile robot platforms, and real-time wireless communication.</p>

<p>The basic premise of the project was extending an iRobot iCreate mobile robot with an infrared imager (a Wiimote IR camera), and utilize the camera for real-time noisy estimates Â of a targetâ€™s position. We showed that such a mobile platform could localize aÂ tetrahedralÂ target to within a few centimeters in approximately 15 seconds. The project was further extended to add real-time, ZigBee-based networking to have multiple robots share observations and showed that the localization time decreased to five seconds and one second with two and three robots respectively. The projectâ€™s technical nature was broad, and required the development of, among other components, particle filters distributed across multiple robots, real-time networking on embedded systems,Â mechatronic design, and a custom PCB design for the Wiimoteâ€™s camera. The project was the focal point of the course, which was taught by Professor Edward Lee and Professor Sanjit Seshia.</p>
