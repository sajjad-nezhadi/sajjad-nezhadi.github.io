I"‹<p>We introduce a generalization of CHSH, viewing it as a linear constraint system game. These provide the first example of non-local games that self-test non-Pauli operators and states other than the maximally entangled state. Finally, we give the first example of a game that is not a self-test. Our results suggest a richer landscape of self-testing phenomena than previously considered.</p>
