We characterize the complexity of exactly computing the maximum winning probability of entangled non-local games and show it to be strictley harder than the halting problem. In particular we show that the class of zero gap entangled multiprover interactive proofs, \\(MIP_0^*\\), is equal to \\(\Pi_2\\) a class within the second level of arithmetical hierrachy from computability theory.
