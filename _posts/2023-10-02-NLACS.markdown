In this work we focus on a specific and natural prerequisite to both NLSS and the QPCP Conjecture, namely, the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states all require ω(log n) T gates to prepare. In fact, we prove a stronger result which is not necessarily implied by either conjecture: we construct local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require Ω(n) T-gates. We further show that our procedure can be applied to the NLTS Hamiltonians to yield local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require both Ω(log n)-depth and Ω(n) T gates to prepare. Our results utilize a connection between T-count and stabilizer groups, which was recently applied in the context of learning low T-count states.
