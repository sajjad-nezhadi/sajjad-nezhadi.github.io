We discuss a technique called recursive compression for proving undecidability results. The technique was originally used [JNV+22] in the breakthrough MIP* = RE result and further developed [MNY22] to prove the Î 2-hardness of the exact quantum value problem. Independently, similar ideas to recursive compression has been used by [DRS10] to prove undecidability results about Wang tilings.
We formulate a general recursive compression lemma which abstracts the technique in all these
above applications. We also prove a converse of the recursive compression lemma showing that the
halting problem is polytime reducible to an RE language if and only if there is a recursive compression
proof. Finally, we generalize the recursive compression lemma throughout the arithmetical hierarchy.
