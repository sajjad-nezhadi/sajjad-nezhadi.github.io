We prove that deciding whether the quantum value of a two-player nonlocal game is exactly equal to 1 is complete for Π2. This shows that exactly computing the quantum value is strictly harder than approximating it, and also strictly harder than computing the commuting operator value (either exactly or approximately). We explain how results about the complexity of nonlocal games all follow in a unified manner from a technique known as compression. At the core of our result is a new gapless compression theorem that holds for both quantum and commuting operator strategies. Our compression theorem yields as a byproduct an alternative proof of Slofstra’s result that the set of quantum correlations is not closed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seyed Sajjad Nezhadi</name></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html">We investigate the connection between the complexity of nonlocal games and the arithmetical hierarchy.
